We tried different rewards:

1) -1 for collision. 10 If reached goal. Stop if coliided.

Advantages: It wants to avoid collisions.
Disadvantages: It does not encourage the robot to go faster. Collisions are inevitable so it cannot learn.

2) Distance to goal when finished.

Advantages: It encourages the robot to travel the most amount of distance better than, before because the reward is more informative.
Disadvantages: It does not encourage the robot to go faster.

3) Tanh of distance covered at each step. -30 if collision. Do not stop until goal reached.

Partial success: The robot learns to go fast but not avoid collisions.
Advantages: It encourages the robot to go faster.
Disadvantages: Collisions are sparse and noisy (only when objects are in a certain threshold).

4) Tanh of distance covered at each step. Collision covered at each step. Do not stop until goal reached.

Partial success: The robot learns to go fast and avoid collisions, but not to a good extent.
Advantages: It encourages the robot to go faster. It tries to avoid collisions.
Disadvantages: It does not perform better than simple default parameters.

4) Tanh of distance covered at each step. Tanh of collision covered at each step. Do not stop until goal reached.
