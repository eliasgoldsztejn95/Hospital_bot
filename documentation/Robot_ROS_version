## Armadillo ##

We tried to work with Armadillo with ROS kinetic, however the hospital world and the simulator were not compatible with the gazebo version.

## ROS kinetic ##

Things we tried:

1) Moving the people with Tal's plugin were they have a mobile invisible base. It works, however the base needs collision to not fall from the ground
   and this collision collides with walls, making the pedestrian simulator complicated to implement (We thought of people moving around the hospital and
   possibly traversing walls.
2) Script that updates the poses of the pedestrian according to the ped_sim ros plugin. The script works, however, when more than two pedestrians are in
   the world, the software is too heavy and they lag.

Things we did not try:

1) Updating Gazebo 9 to Kinect. Supposedly it is compatible, however Tal advised us against it since he said Gazebo is unstable, and not good for
   simulations.
 
## ROS noetic ##

Things we tried:

1) Using ROS kinetic in the Docker, and noetic in the host. In this way we have the upadated versions of Gazebo, needed for the pedestrain simulator and
the hospital world. The armadillo controllers are not compatible to those of noetic.
2) Updating the Gazebo version in the Docker with Kinetic. We were not able to accomplish this after 3 hours of work.
